          <h2>Some Definitions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>security</b> - referencing the system &amp; software security that can be codified into the language itself (i.e. secure information flows, safe execution of arbitrary code)</li>
            <li><b>Safe</b> - considered safe by the language extension. This is the safety that GHC enforces when you have the language extension on making sure that you don't break any of the rules that accompany it.</li>
            <li><b>typesafe</b> - considered safe in terms of types</li> 
          </ul>

          <section>
            <h2>Haskell and Security</h2>
            <p> The traits that make Haskell fun to program in also allow us to make some security assumptions about our code </p>
          </section>
          <section id="fragments">
            <p> Restricting IO and side effects can make our code inherently safer </p>
            <p class="fragment"> constraining where and when IO happens we can have greater control over how our program affects the underlying system</p>
            <p class="fragment"> more rigid type safety can prevent existing code from running in strange and unintended ways</p>

            <h2> Making code useful </h2>
            <p class="fragment"> Unfortunately code often needs IO to be useful. </p>
            <p class="fragment"> Sometimes we want to write Haskell programs that are useful </p>
            <p class="fragment"> IO isn't even inherently dangerous to use in our programs </p>

          <section id="fragments">
            <p> There are however many ways to use IO unsafely, <i>unsafePerformIO</i> being the most obvious example </p>

        </section>
        <section> <!-- slide stack with an example from Data.Bytestring --!>
          <section>
            <h2> An Example </h2>
            <p> Suppose that you are using a library in your code that has only pure functions. </p>
            <p class="fragment"> It would be reasonable to assume that there is no security concern due to IO however; </p>
            <p class="fragment"> functions like unsafePerformIO could subvert that assumption </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p> Look at this example from the popular Data.ByteString library </p>
            <pre><code class="language-haskell" data-trim contenteditable>
            accursedUnutterablePerformIO :: IO a -> a
            accursedUnutterablePerformIO (IO m) = case m realWorld# of (# _, r #) -> r

            inlinePerformIO :: IO a -> a
            inlinePerformIO = accursedUnutterablePerformIO

          </section>
          <section> 
            <p> Which is accompanied by a note saying </p>
            <p>  This "function" has a superficial similarity to 'unsafePerformIO' but
                 it is in fact a malevolent agent of chaos. It unpicks the seams of reality
                 (and the 'IO' monad) so that the normal rules no longer apply. </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p> This is kind of a cheap shot against the ByteString library but it illustrates the point well </p>

        <section> <!-- Slide stack introducing the safe language extension --!>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## A Solution
            The safe language extension provides a way to enforce that only a safe subset of Haskell is used
          </section>
          <section id="fragments">
          <p> Safe accomplishes this goal by restricting some features of the language in order to maintain some safety features of haskell </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment">referential transparency</li>
              <li class="fragment">module boundary control</li>
              <li class="fragment">semantic consistency</li>
              <li class="fragment">a strict subset of language</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="fragment"> The combination of these four items reinforces trust in the types and module import lists </p>

          <section id="fragments">
            <h2>Using Safe</h2>
            <p class="fragment"> Safe can be used like any language extension </p>
            <p class="fragment"> Just add {-# LANGUAGE Safe #-} to your module </p>

            <pre class="fragment"><code class="language-haskell" data-trim contenteditable>

            <p>Safe haskell actually includes 3 different language extensions</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment"> <b>Safe</b> - denoting that a module contains only safe code</li>
              <li class="fragment"> <b>Trustworthy</b> - denoting that a module has unsafe components but the author thinks they are using them safely</li>
              <li class="fragment"> <b>Untrusted</b> - the author knows that the module is not Safe and doesn't want it to compile into any Safe modules</li>

          </section>
          <section id="fragments">
            <p> When managing which modules marked trustworthy can actually be trusted, a problem arises managing the large number of imports that each module usually contains</p>
            <p class="fragment"> This is remedied in Safe Haskell by introducing package trust, denoted by the <b>-fpackage-trust</b> compile flag</p>
          </section> 
          <section id="fragments">
            <p> Each package recognized by GHC can be assigned a trusted or untrusted value which allows large swaths of code to be trusted all at once </p>
            <p class="fragment"> An example of this is the popular Data.Bytestring library which is in the bytestring package, marked trustworthy by hackage</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <pre><code class="language-haskell" data-trim contenteditable>
            {-# LANGUAGE Safe #-}
            module Example where

          </section> 
          <section>
            <p> This example would only compile if we also made sure to tell GHC at compile time that we trust bytestring using <b>-trust bytestring</b> on the command line. </p>
            <p> If we didn't it would refuse to compile because even though we trust GoodModule we do not trust the bystring package and therefore distrust Data.ByteString as well </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p> This gives us the powerful ability to audit packages that we use for security issues by default and anything that is unapproved can be rejected by the compiler </p>
            <p> It also prevents the sneaky inclusion of packages that we don't trust inside packages we do trust since trust is checked recursively all the way down a module. </p>

        <section> <!-- slide stack discussing hard limitations of safe and justifying them --!>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Limitations of Safe
            As I'm sure you've guessed safe does have some hard limitations on what you can do in your code
          </section> 
          <section>
            <h3>Generalised Newtype Deriving</h3>
            GeneralisedNewtypeDeriving is entirely disabled due to the way it can be used to violate module boundaries. This causes Data.Coerce to be considered unsafe.
          </section>
          <section> 
            <h3>GHC.Generic</h3>
            Custom Generic instances are forbidden in Safe Haskell modules. The anyclass derivation strategy is not allowed either. These restrictions are both implimented to protect invariance.
          </section>
          <section> 
            <h3>Template Haskell</h3>
            Due to the fact that TH can give access to a modules protected functions and constructors it isn't allowed within a Safe module
          </section>
          <section> 
            <h3>Overlapping Instances</h3>
            While not prohibited by Safe, OverlappingInstances are restricted and their use is evaluated at compile time to ensure that an outside module cannot affect the intended function of any other module.
          </section>
          <section> 
            <h3>FFI</h3>
            The foreign function interface is restricted to only allowing functions to be imported which have IO type signatures to ensure that uncontrolled side effects are not realized
